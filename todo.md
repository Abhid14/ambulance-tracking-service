So the project is slightly initialized
now just sync the project and then 
run this command

npm install
and let things run


after done

run this command

npm run start

visit this page on your broswer

http://localhost:8080/

you should see something like Ambulance tracker
if not you made some error
contact me!

Update: I checked the entire content and all looks good, it contains basic UI with working backend logic also good work about logo and would appreciate even more if you share the documenatation
